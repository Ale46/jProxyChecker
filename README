jProxyChecker is a Proxy Checker written in java that can determine if a proxy is alive, where is located and the level of his anonimity. 
You can add\delete single proxy, imports a list from your hard drive\remote url and exports the scanned proxy.

WARNING

This code is not tested accurately. The main problems are related to: 
 1. The method that check if a proxy is alive. (funny for a proxy checker, i know) 
 2. The method that test the anon level is only theorical so don't give it too importance. (same fun as 1)
 
 To get  all the "geo-information" is used the maxmindgeoip api.
